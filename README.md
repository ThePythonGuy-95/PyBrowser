This is a simple Python utility to open links to webpages directly from your terminal. With the help of "webbrowser", the script will open the link you entered in your default browser.
Not anything new or ground-breaking, just a simple code I made in my free time, as I enjoy playing around with Python.

You are free to create forks of this utility and make it your own, just make us the favor of acknowledging us in your README. We will be very thankful.



PS: PyBrowser Incorporated is NOT a real company, just something we threw in for some reason!
